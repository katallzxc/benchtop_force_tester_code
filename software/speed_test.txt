50% duty and min on time 0.0001
-----------------------------------------
3 mm/s - 400 steps - loud, buzzy, jerky
4 mm/s better but still quite buzzy
5 mm/s also better just a bit buzzy
6 mm/s similar to 5
7 mm/s stalls, no movement
8 mm/s stalls, no movement
9 mm/s stalls, no movement
10 mm/s stalls, no movement
-----------------------------------------
25% duty and min on time 0.0001
-----------------------------------------
3 mm/s - 400 steps - loud, buzzy, jerky
4 mm/s better but still a bit buzzy
5 mm/s better, just a tiny bit of buzz
6 mm/s fairly smooth but background buzz vibration
7 mm/s fairly smooth but background buzz vibration
8 mm/s fairly smooth but background buzz vibration
9 mm/s fairly smooth but background buzz vibration
10 mm/s  stalls, no movement

SO FAR: seems the 0.001 lower limit on delay time really is needed

3 mm/s - 400 steps - loud, grinding, jerky
4 mm/s loud, buzzy, jerky
5 mm/s better but still quite buzzy
6 mm/s better but still a bit buzzy
7 mm/s better but still a bit buzzy
8 mm/s better but still a bit buzzy
9 mm/s better but still a bit buzzy
10 mm/s OK
12 & up stalls

15% duty and min on time 0.0001
-----------------------------------------
3-5 buzzy 6-10 ok

CONCLUSIONS: 0.001 is true off-time limit, likely need to stick to strict speed set because addressing this with the current equipment is impractical
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
TESTING DIFFERENT DUTY CYCLES BY SPEED
GOAL: find optimal (low-vibration) settings for each integer speed in feasible range
